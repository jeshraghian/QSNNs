This repository contains the corresponding code from the paper *Navigating Local Minima in Quantized Spiking Neural Networks*. 


## Jupyer Notebook
We provide a Jupyer notebook [here](https://github.com/jeshraghian/QSNNs/blob/main/quickstart.ipynb), which includes documentation and information about our developed scripts and methodologies. This can be run in a Google Collaboratory environment without any prerequisites [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jeshraghian/QSNNs/blob/main/quickstart.ipynb).

## Code Execution of Standalone Scripts 
For more advanced users, i.e., those proficient with Python, we provide executable code in the form of Python scripts. Simulations can be run by configuring and executing `run.py` in each respective dataset directory.

## Requirements
### Jupyter Notebook
To run the Jupyter notebook, Google Colab can be used. Otherwise, a working `Python` (≥3.6) interpreter and the `pip` package manager are required.

### Standalone Scripts
To run all standalone scripts, a working `Python` (≥3.6) interpreter and the `pip` package manager. All required libraries and packages can be installed using  `pip install -r requirements.txt`. To avoid potential package conflicts, the use of a `conda` environment is recommended. The following commands can be used to create and activate a separate `conda` environment, clone this repository, and to install all dependencies:

```
conda create -n QSNNs python=3.8
conda activate QSNNs
git clone https://github.com/jeshraghian/QSNNs.git
cd QSNNs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Hyperparameter Tuning
* In each directory, within `run.py` files, the `config` dictionary defines all configuration parameters and parameters for each dataset. 
* The default parameters in this repo are identical to those for the Q4 cosine anneling learning rate schedule configurations reported in the corresponding paper.

## Interpreting and Plotting Results
* Results can be gathered and plotted using `extract_test_set_accuracy.py` and `plot_results.py`, respectively. 
* `plot_results.py` can be reconfigured to plot different quantities.
* By default, `plot_results.py` plots the loss curve evolution during training for all three datasets.
